This project leverages EfficientNetB0 and transfer learning to build a food classification model that identifies dishes and estimates their calorie content. By incorporating image augmentation and structured datasets, the model enhances generalization and robustness, making it useful for applications in nutrition tracking, diet planning, and personalized meal recommendations.
                                                  



Note:Take your own dataset of food images.
